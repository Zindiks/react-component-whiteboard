# Concept: Whiteboard with ReactComponents

The idea is to build something similar to Miro, but instead of using a canvas or SVG, the focus will be on React components. These components will be fully interactive, supporting drag-and-drop functionality and more. Alternatively, it could evolve into a sandbox or an interactive dashboard where users can arrange and manipulate React components on a whiteboard-like interface.
